# yolo-ios

This repository was part of our thesis of machine learning using YOLOv2. The project is an iOS application that allows you to train an object detection model using a pre-built version of the Darknet library compiled directly for the iOS platform.

Credits behind the Darknet library and the YOLOv2 framework goes to creator Joseph Redmon. The full library can be found [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet). The files darknet.h, detector.c and libdarknet.a are from that repository.

The dataset included in this project is a small subset (200 images) of the dataset found here [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces).
